# Inverter Layout Design and Simulation

## Introduction

This project aims to introduce the physical design process of Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) circuits by focusing on the layout design of a simple inverter. The layout process involves the precise placement and routing of geometric shapes, representing various semiconductor layers, to create a functional circuit. The design and verification are conducted using Cadence Virtuoso with the FreePDK45 process design kit, and performance analysis is carried out through HSPICE simulations.

## Inspiration Behind the Project

Understanding the fundamentals of layout design is crucial for developing complex integrated circuits. Starting with a basic component like an inverter allows designers to grasp essential concepts such as design rules, layout-versus-schematic (LVS) checks, and delay analysis. This foundational knowledge is instrumental in progressing to more intricate designs and ensuring their functionality and efficiency.
